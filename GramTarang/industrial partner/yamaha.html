  <h2>Inauguration of Yamaha Motors</h2>
<p>In the premise of Gram Tarang Employability Training Services Pvt. Ltd (GTETS), a social entrepreneurial outreach of Centurion University, India Yamaha Motor Pvt. Ltd, on 13th January, 2015 marked the inauguration of its first Yamaha Training School (YTS) to promote and encourage the economically weaker youth to become self-reliant.

Present at the event, Mr. Masaki Asano, Managing Director, Yamaha Motor India Sales Pvt. Ltd. Said: �At present, there is a huge skills gap in the industry as it heads toward an expansion drive. On the other hand, a large number of unskilled youth are pushed towards unemployment which is a hindrance to any nation�s development. This partnership is meant to address this very concern by providing a platform to the economically weaker and unemployed youth to obtain a job oriented technical training in two-wheeler repair and servicing that meets industry standards. Upon successful completion of the course, the students will receive a certification by Yamaha Technical Academy at Silver level and Gram Tarang Employability Training Services Pvt. Ltd, Bhubaneswar that will help them to find a suitable employment.�</p>
